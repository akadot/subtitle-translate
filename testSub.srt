MAN: West Virginia
Collegiate Institute is

10
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,313
the best school
for Negros in the state.

11
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,690
It's the only school

12
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,733
past the eighth grade
anywhere near here.

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,861
Isosceles.

00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,904
Scalene.

15
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,573
Equilateral.

Rhombus.

Katherine's

19

They want to take her early.

20
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,623
KATHERINE:
Tetrahedron.

21
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,585
Dodecahedron.

22
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,295
MAN: They're offering
a full scholarship.

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,838
All you have to do is get there.

24
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,425
Ms. Coleman,

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,636
why don't you solve
the equation on the board?

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,895
WOMAN:
We took up a collection

27
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,688
amongst the teachers and such.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,856
It's not a lot,

29
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,984
but it's enough
to help get you settled in.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,445
That's more than kind,
Ms. Sumner.

31
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,334
If the product
of two terms is zero,

32
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,877
then common sense says

33
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,172
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

34
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,258
So if you move all the terms
over to one side,

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,052
you can put
the quadratics

36
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,762
into a form
that can be factored,

37
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,555
allowing that side
of the equation

38
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,307
to equal zero.

39
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,475
Once you've done that,

40
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,935
it's pretty straightforward
from there.

41
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,440
SUMNER:
In all my years of teaching,

42
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,236
I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

43
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,656
-MOTHER: Katherine!
-FATHER: Hurry on now, love!

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,199
SUMNER:
You have to go.

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,618
Let Mama tuck you in.

46
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,710
SUMNER: You have to see
what she becomes.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,862
(clattering)

48
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,321

try to turn it over now.

49
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,949
-(cattle moo)
-Katherine?

50
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,742
Mary!

51
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,244
Somebody!

52
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,245
Katherine!

53
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,747
Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over.

54
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,457
I got it.

55
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,420
-I'm not deaf.
-I wonder sometimes.

56
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,464
Here it goes!

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,383
(rapid clicking)

58
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,927
Yeah, it's the starter.

59
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,972
That is definitely the starter.

60
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,932
The starter is
starting to make us late.

61
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,559
We all gonna end up
unemployed

62
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,936
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day.

63
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,105
You're welcome to walk
the 16 miles.

64
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,773
Or sit in the back
of the bus.

65
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,192
(chuckles)

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,152
I won't do neither.

67
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,155
I'll hitchhike.

68
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,657
(vehicle approaching)

69
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,367

72
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,958
No crime
in a broken-down car.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,211
No crime being
Negro neither.

74
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,962
Button it up, Mary.

75
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,423
Nobody wants to go to jail
behind your mouth.

76
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,884
-I'll do my best, sugar.

79
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
Not a great place

80
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,941
for three of y'all
be having car trouble.

81
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,485
We didn't pick the place,
Officer. It picked us.

82
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,153
You being disrespectful?

83
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,696
No, sir.

84
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,490
You have identification on you?

85
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,991
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

86
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,413
We're just on our way
to work at Langley.

87
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,541
NASA, sir.

88
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,584
We do a great deal
of the calculating.

89
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,461
Getting our rockets
into space.

90
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,088
-All three of you?
-Yes, sir.

91
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,130
Yes, Officer.

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,716
NASA.

93
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,927
Now that's something.

94
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,513
I had no idea
they hired...

95
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,348
There are quite
a few women

96
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,100
working in the space program.

97
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,315

98
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,944
Damn Russians are watching us
right now.

99
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,654
Sputniks.

100
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,074
You girls ever meet
those astronauts?

101
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,701
Mercury Seven?

102
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,244
Absolutely.

103
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,748
Uh, yes, sir. We work with
those gentlemen all the time.

104
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,166
Those boys are
the best we got.

105
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,209
I'm sure of that.

106
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,544
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
We gotta get a man up there
before the commies do.

108
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,338
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

109
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,756
Whole damn country's
counting on them.

110
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,216

113
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,388
Right, right. Uh...

114
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,223
Well, do y'all need a tow
or something?

115
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,975
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it.

116
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,226
Just give me my...

117
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,938
Just need to bypass
the starter.

120
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,031
We're all set.

121
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,575
Well, hell, least I can do
is give y'all an escort.

122
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,327
I imagine you're running
late to work.

123
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,162
No, sir. We wouldn't wanna
bother you.

124
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,706
That would be wonderful,
Officer.

125

00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,325
Uh, it looks like
they've achieved

180
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,493
at least one orbit,
maybe two.

181
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,537
(man speaking Russian)

182
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,332
TRANSLATOR (in English):
Chernushka is ready to go again.

183
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,961
So is our comrade, Ivan,
a brave space traveler.

184
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,714
We have proven life can be
sustained in space.

185
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,008
Now we will be first
to send a human...

186
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,053
WEBB: A damn dog
and a damn mannequin.

187
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:38,268
And then a one-point-six megaton
RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead

188
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,979
drops down in the middle
of Des Moines.

189
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,813
Well, that's
a pretty big jump, sir.

190
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,732
What?

191
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,276
-Just that... (stammers)
-Who the hell is he?

192
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,487
Paul Stafford, our lead
engineer, Mr. Webb.

193
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,821
I think what
he meant to say

194
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,031
is that speculation,

195
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,324
at least on our side
of the equation,

196
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,245
by definition can be...
just a little dangerous.

197
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,496
Dangerous?

198
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,123
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

199
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,751
Inaction and indecision.

200
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,752
The Russians...

201
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,838
have a spy satellite
lapping the planet,

202
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,466
taking pictures
of God knows what!

203
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,927
The president is demanding
an immediate response.

204
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:12,886
No more delay.

205
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,304
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,
your Uncle Bob,

206
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,056
it doesn't matter.
Get us up there, Harrison.

207
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,392
We can't justify
a space program

208
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,853
that doesn't put
anything in space.

209
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,855
(murmuring)

210
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,648
How'd that feel
in there, Paul?

211
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,568
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

212
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,735
Hmm?

213
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,321
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

214
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,156
He look enlightened
to you, Sam?

215
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,576
-Not particularly.
-And just so you know,

216
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,160
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

217
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,745
You know that, right?

218
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,497
Because now
that they can get up there,

219
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,416
a bomb will follow.

220
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,668
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

221
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,129
I imagine theirs too.
Where...

222
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,547
Where's the machine?

223
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,923
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

224
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,301
-Any day now.
-Yes, sir.

225
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,845
What's it called?
The initials.

226
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,054
The IBM.

227
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,764
International
Business Machines.

228
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,726
Space as a business.
(scoffs)

229
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,144
I need a mathematician.

230
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,770
I'll put in another
request, sir.

231
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,480
"Another request."
Jesus Christ.

232
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,733
We don't have a single
person in this entire building

233
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,818
that can handle
analytic geometry?

234
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,986
That's what I've been told.

235
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,529
Yeah. Well, tell me
something else, Ruth,

236
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,114
like we're gonna find
such a person

237
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,365
before the Russians
plant a flag

238
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,326
on the damn Moon.

239
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,628
(chattering)

240
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,712
DOROTHY:
All right, Gloria,

241
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,131
you'll be
with engineering, building four.

242
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,051
Ladies, ladies.

243
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,761
If you're tardy, you
don't get an assignment.

244
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,804
If you don't get an assignment,
you don't have a job.

245
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,100
Eleanor.
Data Reduction, building 202.

246
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,227
Data Reduction?

247
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,062
Well, you're welcome
to join the charmers

248
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,106
-in Magnetoplasmadynamics.
-Oh, no, ma'am.

249
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,484
Thank you.
Data Reduction is just fine.

250
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,194
Mm-hmm.

251
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,738
-Mary.
-Present.

252
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,324
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

253
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,286
Mr. Zielinski's requesting you
for permanent assignment.

254
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,914
-Are you serious?
-Get moving.

255
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,378
Ooh, thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus!

256
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,963
-Oh, thank you.
-(quietly) Mary, Mary.

257
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,047
Keep it inside.

258
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,550
(whispering)
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

259
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,428
DOROTHY:
All right, Miss Late.

260
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,514
You will also be supporting
the East group.

261
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,475
DOROTHY:
Mrs. Mitchell.

262
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,561
We're on double-time
this morning, girls.

263
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,564
I need these calculations
before lunch.

264
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,817
Space Task Group needs
a computer, ASAP.

265
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,111
Someone with a handle
on analytic geometry.

266
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,155
We can't fill that position
out of the East group.

267
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,448
Permanent or temp?

268
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,868
Everything's temporary,
Dorothy.

269
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,704
-You have someone?
-Yes, ma'am.

270
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,789
Katherine's the gal for that.

271
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,125
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

272
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,043
I'll check her credentials.

273
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,796
(muttering)
Didn't think I'd come

274
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,131
all the way down here.

275
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,008
Here. Finish passing those out.

276
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,467
WOMAN:
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,390
Mrs. Mitchell.

278
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,892
If I could?

279
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,520
My application
for supervisor, ma'am.

280
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,730
Was just wondering

281
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,815
if they're still considering
me for that position.

282
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,736
Yes. Well,
the official word is no.

283
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,154
They're not assigning

284
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,822
a permanent supervisor
for the colored group.

285
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:22,326
-May I ask why?
-I don't know why.

286
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,704
-I didn't ask why.
-We need a supervisor, ma'am.

287
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,290
We haven't had one since
Miss Jansen got sick.

288
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,374
It's been almost a year.

289
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,668
Things are working
just fine as is.

290
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,630
I'm doing the work
of a supervisor.

291
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,090
Well, that's NASA for you.

292
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,260
Fast with rocket ships,
slow with advancement.

293
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,846
Get those trajectory calcs
worked out.

294
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,098
We need them
for the Redstone test.

295
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,759
Mach 1 tunnel test.
T-minus one minute.

296
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,179
(alarm blaring)

297
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,810
(grunts)

298
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,357
No shoe is worth your life.

299
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,109
One--
One moment.

300
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,862
T-minus 10, nine,

301
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,823
eight, seven, six,

302
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,284
five, four...

303
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,619
(alarm continuing outside)

304
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,374
(machines beeping)

305
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:01,341
(clattering)

306
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,978
Shut it down.

307
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:23,155
If we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated,

308
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,782
the capsule might have
more stability.

309
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,244
But the friction it is
under during reentry...

310
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,581
Most shield erosion occurs

311
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,542
on the posterior side
abutting the retro-boosters.

312
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,711
Conclusion?

313
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,257
The area closest
to the boosters

314
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,510
is closest to the heat.

315
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,929
Coupled with rise
in temperature on reentry,

316
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,681
the contact softens.

317
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,099
We could consider

318
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,268
another fastener
other than the bolts.

319
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,438
Yes.

320
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,815
Yes.

321
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:08,367
There is another opening
in the engineer training program.

322
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,869
Flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag.

323
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,872
Mary, a person
with engineer's mind

324
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,790
should be an engineer.

325
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,334
You can't be a computer
the rest of your life.

326
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,253
Mr. Zielinski,

327
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,963
I'm a Negro woman.

328
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,006
I'm not gonna entertain
the impossible.

329
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,550
And I'm a Polish Jew

330
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,718
whose parents died
in a Nazi prison camp.

331
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,930
Now I'm standing
beneath a spaceship

332
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,058
that's going to carry
an astronaut to the stars.

333
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,645
I think we can say
we are living the impossible.

334
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:40,858
Let me ask you,
if you were a white male,

335
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,527
would you wish to be
an engineer?

336
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,905
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

337
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,366
MITCHELL: Skirts must be worn
past the knee.

338
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,702
Sweaters are preferred
to blouses.

339
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,786
No jewelry.

340
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,122
A simple pearl necklace
is the exception.

341
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:58,041
Your supervisor is
Mr. Al Harrison,

342
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,377
director of
the Space Task Group.

343
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,755
You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

344
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,426
Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

345
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,053
Not many computers last
more than a few days.

346
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,890
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

347
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,558
Come on, keep up.

348
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,393
Things move fast around here.

349
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,063
Your clearance.

350
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,858
They've never had a colored
in here before, Katherine.

351
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,235
Don't embarrass me.

352
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,991
(sighs)

353
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,791
-(indistinct chattering)
-(typewriters clacking)

354
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,835
(telephone ringing)

355
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,678
This wasn't emptied
last night.

356
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,097
I'm sorry, I'm not the...

357
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,266
(quietly)
custodian.

358
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,449
Excuse me, ma'am.

359
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,660
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

360
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,163
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get your work in a... bit.

361
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,044
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

362
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,088
Do your work,
keep your head down.

363
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,424
-Thank you.
-Go on. Get settled.

364
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,354
Paul?

365
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,607
Why are we still losing
shingles off the heat shield?

366
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,068
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

367
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,736
Its lid is
one-third the size--

368
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,405
I get that. So...

369
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,700
what do we do with
our million-dollar fan, Karl?

370
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,244
-Turn it down?
-No, Al. I don't think--

371
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,662
It was a joke.

372
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,915
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off,

373
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,667
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

374
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,878
-I know.
-So we're gonna...

375
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,963
We're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

376
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,798
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

377
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,675
HARRISON: Ruth, what's
the status on that computer?

378
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,969
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

379
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,351
Does she handle
analytic geometry?

380
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,396
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

381
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,689
Yes, sir. I do.

382
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,567
-Which one?
-Both.

383
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,110
Geometry and speaking.

384
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,323
Ruth, get me the...

385
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,411
You think you, uh...

386
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,080
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame for this data?

387
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,666
-Using the Gram-Schmidt--
-Orthogonalization algorithm.

388
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,667
Yes, sir.

389
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,337
I prefer it
over Euclidean coordinates.

390
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,967
Okay, good.

391
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,011
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

392
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,346
Yes, sir.

393
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,765
I'm also gonna ask you
to check Mr. Stafford's math

394
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,975
as well as others' on this floor
from time to time.

395
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,769
I can...
I can handle that, Al.

396
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,646
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

397
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,064
But if that were the case,

398
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,190
shingles wouldn't be

399
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,942
flying off the heat shield,
now would they?

400
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,862
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

401
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,280
for a moment?

402
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,283
Thank you.
Just, uh...

403
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,786
Just to be clear,

404
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,830
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

405
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,834
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

406
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,545
asking us questions
about our work.

407
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,171
I think that's
pretty reasonable given

408
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,590
we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

409
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,591
shooting him into space,

410
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,093
and it's never been
done before.

411
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,511
(laughing)

412
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,929
Because it's never been done,

413
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,181
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

414
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,602
It's gonna matter
to their wives,

415
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,813
to their children.

416
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,107
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

417
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:55,112
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

418
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,490
America's greatest
engineering and scientific minds

419
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,577
are not gonna have a problem
with having their work checked.

420
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,204
-Are they, Paul?
-No, sir.

421
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,290
Good. So let's have
an amen, damn it.

422
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,916
ALL (mutter):
Amen.

423
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,169
ALL (louder):
Amen!

424
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,837
All right.

425
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,687
(marker squeaking)

426
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,075
My numbers are spot-on.

427
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,163
I will double-check them, sir.
No problem.

428
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,797
Uh...

429
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,633
-I'm not gonna be able--
-Work on what you can read.

430
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,427
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

431
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,905
RUTH: These are the numbers
Mr. Harrison gave me.

432
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,032
-Yes, I'm absolutely--
-Excuse me.

433
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,700
May I ask where
the ladies' room is?

434
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,995
Sorry. I have no idea
where your bathroom is.

435
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,248
Yes, sir.

436
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,083
Uh, yes, sir.

00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,427

Are you finished yet?

472
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:35,999
Uh...

473
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,751
Almost. He said
by the end of the day.

474
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,045
The end of the day around here
is yesterday.

475
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,422
-(banging on glass)
-I need those done first.

476
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,757
He wants
those done first.

477
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,175
-Okay.
-Get going.

478
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,177
HARRISON:
I'm sorry about that.

479
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,887
Somebody's working on it
right now.

480
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,766
(chattering)

481
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,829
KATHERINE:
Mr. Harrison?

482
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,458
Oh, yeah. Uh,
just set it-- you know.

483
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,671
And Stafford's
heat shield calcs?

484
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,634
It's hard
to be sure, sir.

485
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,844
(mutters)
Hard to be sure.

486
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,513
You know
we're doing here?

487
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,183
Trying to put
a man into space, sir.

488
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,393
That's right.

489
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,479
That's right. So you can throw
that in the trash.

490
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,481
Excuse me?

491
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,566
I said you can throw it away.

492
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,984
Here.

493
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,737
It's not an insult
to your work.

494
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,447
It's just obsolete.

495
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,824
That's how fast things are
moving around here.

496
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,285
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

497
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,246
What I'm asking you to do,

498
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,956
what I'm asking everyone
in that room,

499
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:43,752
all my geniuses,
is to look beyond the numbers,

500
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,838
to look around them,

501
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,631
through them,

502
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,717
for answers to questions
we don't even know to ask.

503
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,345
Math that doesn't
yet exist.

504
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,556
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

505
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,558
I mean, we're staying
on the ground. We're not...

506
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,477
flying into space,
we're not circling the Earth,

507
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,354
and we're certainly not
touching the Moon.

508
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,773
And in my mind...

509
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,150
In my mind,
I'm already there.

510
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,404
Are you?

511
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,115
Yes, sir.

512
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,576
Good.

513
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,203
'Cause I don't need another
smart girl with an adding machine.

514
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,791
Can I go, sir?

515
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,086
(mutters)
Yeah... go...

516
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,838
Yeah, go.
Yeah, go.

517
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,716
Yes, you can go.

518
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,193

you take the bus.

♪ In my heart ♪

531
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,689
I haven't been late
one day in 10 years.

532
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,484
Haven't been out sick.
Haven't complained.

533
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,443
My work's on time.

534
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,111
It's done right.
It's done well.

535
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,530
It's not fair,
that's a fact.

536
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,489
What's not fair

537
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,407
is having the responsibility
of a supervisor

538
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,035
-but not the title or the pay.
-MARY: Mmm.

539
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,162
And watching you two move on.

540
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,122
Now, don't get me wrong.

541
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,708
Any upward movement is
movement for us all.

542
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:50,003
Just isn't movement for me.

543
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,630
Truth be told, Dorothy,
I don't even know

544
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,299
if I can keep up
in that room.

545
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,010
I'll be back
with the computers in a week.

546
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,930
-Or out of a job entirely.
-DOROTHY: Oh, please.

547
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:01,890
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

548
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:02,933
Katherine,
and you know it.

549
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,185
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does,

550
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,562
you'll be fine.

551
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,939
And you,
have some respect.

552
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,315
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

553
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,484
This isn't
your living room.

554
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:17,698
I sound like
a supervisor, don't I?

555
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,449
A mean old salty one.

556
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,493
Riddled with authority,
no question.

557
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:22,744
(laughs)

558
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,746
You don't mess
with Mrs. Vaughan.

559
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,875
Turn that music up.

560
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,711
♪ They'll say anything
just to make me feel bad ♪

561
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,046

565
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,684
-DOROTHY: Good night, Katherine.
-MARY: Bye, Kat.

566
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:49,021
Good night, ladies.
See you in the morning.

567
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,526
(slow jazz music playing softly)

568
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,073
-Hey, baby.
-Hello, Mama.

569
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,826
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

570
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,748
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

571
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,708
Space Task Group.

572
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,877
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

573
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,879
It's a promotion?

574
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:14,838
(chuckles)

575
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,341
It might be
a slight promotion.

576
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,468
But you want the job, right?

577
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,304
I think so.

578
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:24,223
It's a challenge, but...

579
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,433
Well, it's nothing
you can't handle, Katherine.

580
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:31,313
-Thank you, Mama.
-(chuckles)

581
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:34,608
-Are they asleep yet?
-They're pretending to be.

582
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,860
(children arguing)

583
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,779
They're not pretending
well enough.

584
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,782
-GIRL: Constance!
-Thank you, Mama. Love you.

585
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,409
-This is my bed.
-No. Get off!

586
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,911
-Go back to yours! I'm oldest!
-No.

587
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,120
Get off!

588
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,539
What are you doing?

589
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,250
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

590
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,043
because she's the oldest.

591
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,670
-Yes, it is fair.
-No, it's not.

592
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,129
-Nuh-uh.
-Nuh-uh.

593
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,674
Constance, Kathy, sit.

594
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,888
Now, I understand

595
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,933
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

596
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:12,354
So, whoever sleeps in that bed,
in Joylette's place,

597
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,899
will also do the dishes,
take out the trash,

598
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,819
and do all
of Joylette's chores.

599
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,321
That's okay.
Never mind.

600
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,115
Yeah, she's not so terrible
to share with.

601
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,157
(chuckles)

602
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,911
Okay. Then don't let me
come home

603
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,163
and find you like this again,
you hear me?

604
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,749
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

605
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,459
We just wanted to say
good night.

606
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,296
You've been gone
for 300 hours.

607
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,508
I know. I work
a full-time job now.

608
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,051
You all know that.

609
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,848
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

610
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,230
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

611
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,608
He's with the angels.

612
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,735
Yes, he's with
all the angels.

613
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,570
And he's watching over us.

614
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,989
Every minute, okay?

615
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,533
That's why
we have to be strong.

616
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,576
All right?

617
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,077
-Yes, Mama.
-Yes, Mama.

618
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,996
Y'all get some rest, okay?

619
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,665
-Mama?
-Yes, baby?

620
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,001
Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

621
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,878
Where'd you get that from?

622
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,255
We had to hide
under our desks today,

623
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,965
all scrunched up.

624
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,176
Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

625
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,802
It means, uh...

626
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,221
you practice safety

627
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,932
just in case
something happens.

628
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,229
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

629
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,440
-You going to space, too?
-No, baby.

630
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,818
But I'm going to do
what I can

631
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,988
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

632
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,991
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

633
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,618
You could be an astronaut.

634
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,412
-Did you draw this?
-Yes, Mama.

635
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,455
(laughs)

636
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,040
Is that me?

637
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,917
Mmm-hmm.

638
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,378
You see this?

639
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,129
Oh, my goodness.

640
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,756
I love you, baby.

641
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,552
I know. I know.
Come here.

642
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,971
All right. Now this time
really go to bed.

643
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,639
(kisses) Okay?

644
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,558
-I love y'all.
-Good night.

645
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,725
-Good night.
-Good night, Mama.

646
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,686
I love my picture, baby.

647
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:24,444
(choir singing)

648
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,612
Thank you, Lord.

649
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,075
-Praise God!
-Praise God!

650
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,744
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

651
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,790
-Hallelujah.
-(murmurs of approval)

652
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,168
-Praise God...
-Praise God.

653
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,045
...that change is coming.

654
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,881
(murmurs of approval)

655
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:47,384
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference

656
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,511
to the good Reverend Dr. King...

657
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,221
-Amen!
-Hallelujah!

658
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,472
...to the students sitting in

659
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:54,474
at lunch counters
in North Carolina.

660
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,601
-That's right.
-Yes, sir.

661
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,146
His faith in us has no limit.

662
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:00,522
The good Lord

663
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:04,359
has our very own women
working on rocket ships!

664
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,986
(applause)

665
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,951
And we have National Guardsmen
defending our freedom.

666
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,370
Give a shout of praise
for Colonel Jim Johnson.

667
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:17,998
(applause)

668
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,042
Returning home,
by the grace of God

669
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:25,047
to set up a National Guard unit
right here in Hampton.

670
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,174
Can I get
a hallelujah in here?

671
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,842
Hallelujah!

672
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,554
(church bell ringing)

673
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,431
I just don't understand.

674
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,642
I just... I don't--
I don't understand it.

675
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,685
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

676
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,188
But a female engineer?

677
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,941
A female engineer?
We're Negro, baby.

678
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,442
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

679
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:46,902
It's not like
that there, Levi.

680
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,445
You can't apply for freedom.

681
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,323
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

682
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,408
It's got to be demanded, taken.

683
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,369
Stop quoting
your slogans at me.

684
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,746
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

685
00:33:57,788 --> 00:33:58,789
I don't want any greens.

686
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,874
Hey. I tell you about
interrupting?

687
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,626
Here. Try this, baby.

688
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:05,754
Yes.

689
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,631
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

690
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,800
Kids need to eat
their vegetables.

691
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,552
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

692
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,973
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

693
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,724
Unless you want
this female's mind,

694
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,976
right here,
in front of everybody.

695
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,274
(quietly) Alls I'm saying,
don't play the fool.

696
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,317
I don't wanna see
you get hurt.

697
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,402
NASA's never, ever given
you gals your due.

698
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:33,532
Having a couple of extra degrees
ain't gonna change that.

699
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,909
Civil rights ain't
always civil.

700
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,166
I don't want
any greens either.

701
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,376
No lip, little miss.

702
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,835
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

703
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,466
I hear he's planning on
staying in the area.

704
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,761
Well...
Well, that's good for him.

705
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,389
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

706
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,601
That Colonel Jim is
a tall glass of water.

707
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,060
That he is.

708
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,771
-Tall, strong, commanding.
-Oh...

709
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,191
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

710
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,943
-Mary, it's Sunday.
-(scoffs)

711
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:13,447
-Please have some shame.
-I will not.

712
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,283
Hmm, I think
he's smiling over here.

713
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,993
At you.

714
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,207
Well, I'm not smiling back.

715
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,374
-Yes, you are.
-Oh, child.

716
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,835
-You are all teeth right now.
-I am not.

717
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,754
(mouthing) Come over
here and say hi.

718
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:29,796
DOROTHY:
He's coming over.

719
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,381
KATHERINE: Now, why would
he be doing that?

720
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,175
-'Cause Mary's waving at him.
-No!

721
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,385
-Ladies, I'm not ready.
-It's too late. Fix your hair.

722
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,222
Hello, Colonel.
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

723
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:39,223
That's Mary Jackson.

724
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:40,516
I believe you met
her husband, Levi.

725
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:41,850
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

726
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,769
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

727
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,687
She's not married.
She's a widow,

728
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,023
with three
beautiful little girls.

729
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,274
So well behaved.

730
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,568
Angels on Earth is
what we like to call them.

731
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,362
Dorothy,
slice of pie?

732
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,698
I'd love one.
Excuse me.

733
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,034
-You already have a slice of pie, Dorth--
-Uh-huh.

734
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,415
Well, I was just, uh, fixing
my three babies some plates.

735
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,669
-Let me help you.
-Sure.

736
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,004
Uh, fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

737
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,551
Pastor mentioned
you're a computer at NASA.

738
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,428
-Yes.
-What's that entail?

739
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,932
Um... we calculate
the mathematics necessary

740
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,643
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

741
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,312
(laughing) That's
pretty heady stuff.

742
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,605
Yes, it is.

743
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,441
They let women handle
that sort of... (stammers)

744
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,988
That's...
not what I mean.

745
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,906
What do you mean?

746
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,200
Well...

747
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,495
I'm just surprised
that something so...

748
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,623
-taxing.
-Hmm.

749
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,251
Mr. Johnson.

750
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,628
If I were you,
I'd quit talking right now.

751
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,089
I didn't mean
no disrespect.

752
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,549
I will have you know,

753
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,759
I was the first
Negro female student

754
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,721
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

755
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:04,308
On any given day,
I analyze the manometer levels

756
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,935
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity,

757
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,521
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

758
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:13,609
by cosine, square root,
and, lately, analytic geometry.

759
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,027
By hand.

760
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,696
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

761
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,698
Negro women
in the West Computing Group,

762
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,951
and we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

763
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,328
So, yes.

764
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,247
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

765
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,083
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

766
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,253
It's because
we wear glasses.

767
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,713
Have a good day.

768
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,219
-(band playing patriotic march)
-(applauding)

769
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,396
Scott, welcome to Langley.

770
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,357
-Welcome to Langley.
-Welcome.

771
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,776
HARRISON: Good to have you here,
gentlemen.

772
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,153
(cheering, whistling)

773
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,577
Thank you.

774
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,413
That's Alan Shepard,
US Navy pilot.

775
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,415
He could be
the first man in space.

776
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,252
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra,

777
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,962
also Navy pilots.

778
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,840
All under 5' 11", 180 pounds.

779
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,633
-IQs over 130.
-Mmm.

780
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,718
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

781
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,596
How could you possibly
be ogling these white men?

782
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:25,806
It's equal rights.

783
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,808
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

784
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,686
DOROTHY:
And that's John Glenn.

785
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,187
He's the only
Marine Corps pilot.

786
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,898
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

787
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,817
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

788
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,569
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

789
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,571
-Ruth, he's fine.
-He's coming this way.

790
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,489
-KATHERINE: Look straight ahead.
-MARY: Look right him.

791
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,367
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

792
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,035
They seem to be
in a big rush around here.

793
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,162
Well, the Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

794
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,831
You know, they can't build
a damn refrigerator.

795
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,291
How the heck did
they beat us into space?

796
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:53,709
(all laughing)

797
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,169
GLENN: And what do you ladies
do for NASA?

798
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,796
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

799
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,339
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

800
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,382
No, sir.

801
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,384
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.

802
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:03,719
Engineering.

803
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,637
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

804
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,889
Thank you, Mary.

805
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,724
John.

806
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,767
-John, let's take it inside.
-Yes, sir.

807
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,686
-Guys.
-Nice meeting you guys.

808
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,062
-Thank you, Colonel.
-Good luck, sir.

809
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,480
God bless you all.

810
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,442
Thank you.
Wonderful.

811
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,401
Thank you!

812
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:26,074
-(phones ringing)
-(chattering)

813
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,517
Mr. Harrison wants
you to confirm

814
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,144
launch and landing
for the Redstone rocket test.

815
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:02,152
I cannot work on
what I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

816
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,820
It's illegible.

817
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,531
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

818
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,491
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

819
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,743
This is more or less
a dummy check.

820
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,240
We have one, you make it two.
Make it double, okay?

821
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,075
You gotta get it--
Just make it happen.

822
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,247
No one thought
to measure these things?

823
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,915
I'm afraid not, sir.

824
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,544
Well, would you
like us to stop?

825
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,172
No. No, no, just...

826
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,632
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

827
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,428
In fact,
use the big hammer.

828
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,971
Yes, sir.

829
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,724
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go. Go.

830
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,368
(phone ringing)

831
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,751
Ma'am.

832
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,256
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

833
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,175
You need to be working,
not walking.

834
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:51,553
Oh. It's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

835
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,388
Well, since you
made the trip,

836
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,766
you can take that batch
over there.

837
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,143
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

838
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:04,149
-You need something else?
-Yes, ma'am. Um...

839
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,901
I was wondering if you know

840
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,611
what they're building
over in the tech wing.

841
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,907
It's called an IBM.

842
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,159
A mainframe machine.

843
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,744
Apparently, it can do
our calculations

844
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,496
in a fraction of the time.

845
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,122
Hmm.

846
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,500
I guess that's good for NASA.

847
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,547
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

848
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:38,934
(grunts)

849
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,107
Excuse me.

850
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,303
Hi.

851
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,643
What are you
looking at, Paul?

852
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,361
Is that correct?

853
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:33,739
Yeah.

854
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:41,663
Whose work is that?

855
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,751
I said,
whose work is that?

856
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,297
Katherine Goble, sir.

857
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,302
-Hello.
-Hi.

858
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:56,678
PAUL:
How did you know the Redstone

859
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,971
couldn't support orbital flight?

860
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,891
-That's classified information.
-It's top secret.

861
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,477
Well, it's no secret why
the Redstone tests keep failing.

862
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:04,811
It's fine
for suborbital flight,

863
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:06,563
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

864
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,649
and push it into space.

865
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,318
Numbers don't lie.

866
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,946
And you figured
all that out with this?

867
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,658
Half the data is redacted.

868
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,203
Well, what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

869
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,163
The distance from
launch to orbit, we know.

870
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:24,456
Redstone mass, we know.

871
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,583
Mercury capsule weight,
we know.

872
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:29,378
And the speeds are
there in the data.

873
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:33,298
-You did the math.
-Yes, sir.

874
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,259
I looked beyond.

875
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,721
And how do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

876
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,852
That's not math.

877
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:47,980
That data is not here.
Like he said, it's classified.

878
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,779
I held it up to the light.

879
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,406
You held it
up to the light?

880
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:58,448
Yes, sir.

881
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,914
-Well, there it is.
-KATHERINE: Mmm-hmm.

882
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,168
Atlas.

883
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,837
-What's your name?
-Katherine Goble.

884
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,591
-Are you a spy, Katherine?
-Am I what?

885
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,176
I said, are you
a Russian spy?

886
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,427
No, sir.

887
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,512
I'm not Russian.

888
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,265
She's not
Russian, sir.

889
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,852
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

890
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:27,978
Give her everything she needs

891
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,147
to work on Shepard's
trajectories without redaction.

892
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:32,858
-Are we clear on that?
-Are we sure about this?

893
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,235
What's the issue, Paul?
You heard her.

894
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,487
She's not a spy.

895
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,239
I-- I just don't think
it's a good idea.

896
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:43,076
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

897
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,494
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

898
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,747
-Ruth, could you pass it along?
-Yes, sir.

899
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:49,166
-Thank you, Katherine.
-Thank you, sir.

900
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,460
(sighs)

901
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,633
This interrogation's over.

902
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,607
(chatting)

903
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,611
MARY: You can probably
get to the Moon

904
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,570
and back with this.

905
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,113
Just not the bathroom.

906
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,449
Well, at least they're
not blind of what you do.

907
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:23,700
It's not gonna
matter soon.

908
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:26,495
This IBM's gonna
put us all out of work.

909
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:28,789
How you doing?
What can we do about it?

910
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,291
-How you doing?
-Only one thing to do.

911
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,585
Learn all we can,
make ourselves valuable.

912
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:35,087
Somewhere down the line,
a human being

913
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,338
is gonna have to push
the buttons.

914
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,798
That's right.

915
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,718
Oh, mercy.

916
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,220
MARY:
Well, she must be lost.

917
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,805
NASA doesn't
commission females

918
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,224
for the engineer
training program.

919
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:51,103
That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

920
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,022
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

921
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,357
I have a bachelor's degree

922
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,608
in mathematics
and physical science.

923
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,652
It's the same as most
engineers around here.

924
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:01,238
Well, we now require
advanced extension courses

925
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,906
through
the University of Virginia.

926
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:05,158
It's in the employee handbook,
in addendum.

927
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:08,161
In case you haven't read it.

928
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,581
Every time we have
a chance to get ahead,

929
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:11,832
they move the finish line.

930
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,417
I just follow
the rules around here,

931
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,252
and I expect everyone
who works for me

932
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:16,253
to follow them as well.

933
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:19,590
There are no special
circumstances for anyone.

934
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,134
Y'all should be thankful
you have jobs at all.

935
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:29,725
"For those that cannot
attend classes

936
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,560
"at the University of Virginia,

937
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,104
"advanced extension courses
are available

938
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:36,690
at the Hampton
High School."

939
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:39,067
That's still a segregated
school, Mary.

940
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,987
Virginia acts like Brown
versus Board of Education

941
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,197
never happened.

942
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,324
They are never gonna allow
a colored woman

943
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:47,492
to just take classes
at an all-white school.

944
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,411
Well, sounds
about right.

945
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,038
That's all you gonna say?

946
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,915
Well, I'm not gonna sit here
all day and listen to you

947
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,249
complain about
the way things are.

948
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,250
We're trying to play cards.

949
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:56,460
Petition the court.

950
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,629
Fight for what you want.
But quit talking about it.

951
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,425
-I've been complaining?
-For days.

952
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:07,930
Ladies...
not one more peep about work.

953
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:10,140
-Deal me in.
-Katherine?

954
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:11,725
-MARY: Come on.
-KATHERINE: Oh, no.

955
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:12,935
-MARY: Right here.
-You.

956
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,978
-Child, I needed this.
-(blues music playing)

957
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,188
Thank you.

958
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,524
-(whoops)
-(laughs)

959
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,901
Don't give her
anymore, Katherine.

960
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,195
-I can't. She drank it all.
-(chuckles)

961
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,614
Listen, I'm fine.

962
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:27,699
I'm as fine
as I have ever been.

963
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,576
You're drunk
as you've ever been.

964
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:30,827
(laughs)

965
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,163
Come on.
Let's dance, ladies.

966
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,457
Come on, Kat.
Let's dance.

967
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:36,792
Go and dance with her,
Katherine.

968
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:37,835
Come on.

969
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,586
-Get out here.
-Hide that.

970
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,713
-We gonna teach you how to dance.
-You go ahead.

971
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,799
All right. Slow.

972
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,592
We gonna teach you
how to get a man.

973
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,594
-Teach me what?
-Come on!

974
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,388
You got to know how to dance.

975
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,014
-Slow. Slow.
-Come on.

976
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,141
-Twirl it around.
-Twirl, twirl.

977
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,394
-Yes!
-Twirl, twirl, twirl.

978
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,229
Whoo! Look at her, Dorothy.

979
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,398
Can I win me one of those
fancy dance contests?

980
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:00,774
Whip it around.

981
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,150
(laughing)

982
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:03,777
-Yeah, and on the outside.
-(people chanting)

983
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,237
Was it better than Mama's?

984
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,197
-No, not really.
-Segregation must go!

985
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,283
CROWD (chanting):
Segregation must go!

986
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:10,993
Segregation must go!

987
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,744
Segregation must go!

988
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,122
-Segregation must go!
-(barking)

989
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:19,001
Segregation must go!
Segregation must go!

990
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,460
Segregation must go!

991
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,171
Don't pay attention
to all that.

992
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,964
We're not part
of that trouble. Go on.

993
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:28,051
Segregation must go!
Segregation must go!

994
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,345
Segregation must go!

995
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,269
"Mind.
They must have done..."

996
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,104
(continues indistinctly)

997
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,568
We don't want
any trouble in here.

998
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,862
Oh, I'm not here
for any trouble, ma'am.

999
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:50,365
-What are you here for?
-A book.

1000
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:54,203
You have books
in the colored section.

1001
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,079
It doesn't have
what I'm looking for.

1002
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,540
Well, that's
just the way it is.

1003
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,795
Go on, now.
You know better than this.

1004
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,132
Get your hands off my boys!
Don't touch them.

1005
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,134
You have a blessed day.

1006
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,019
DOROTHY:
Separate and equal

1007
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,063
are two different things.

1008
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:23,815
Just 'cause it's the way,
doesn't make it right.

1009
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:26,902
-Understand?
-Yes, Mama.

1010
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,404
You act right,
you are right.

1011
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,198
That's for certain.

1012
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,575
-Understand?
-Yes, Mama.

1013
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,500
You took
that book, Mama?

1014
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,585
Son, I pay taxes.

1015
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:45,754
And taxes pay
for everything in that library.

1016
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:48,006
You can't take something
you already paid for.

1017
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:56,098
"Fortran is a new
and exciting language

1018
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:59,643
"used by programmers
to communicate with computers.

1019
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:03,021
It is exciting as it is
the wave of the future."

1020
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:07,484
-All right, everybody smile.
-Aw!

1021
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:10,445

00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:12,155
-Make a wish.
-Blow.

00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,616
KATHERINE: Try again.
There you go.

1024
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,828
Leonard, you need
to get you a job now.

1025
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,414
-Mm-hmm.
-Two jobs.

1026
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:21,874
-Your baby is nine...
-Thank you, man.

1027
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,542
Yeah, you're
just in time.

1028
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:25,002
Well, look at that.

1029
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:27,129
-Look at what?
-What a surprise.

1030
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,673
Can't complain, man.
It's been working out well.

1031
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:31,675
-I'll say.
-(scoffs)

1032
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,219
-Howard must have invited him.
-Mmm-hmm.

1033

00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:18,972
-Well, was that it?
-(chuckles)

1049
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:21,016

1053
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:35,656
I'm afraid I simply misspoke
the other day, Mrs. Goble.

1054
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,824
(slow ballad playing)

1055
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,994
I've been away
for a long time.

1056
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:44,581
I imagine
I'm just out of practice.

1057
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,291
Mmm-hmm.

1058
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,836
I was hoping you'd allow me
to start over.

1059
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,588
Mmm-hmm.

1060
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,674
See, the thing is,

1061
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:56,301
I have an interest
in getting to know you better.

1062
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,096
-Mmm-hmm.
-(chuckles)

1063
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,014
You're one tough
customer, huh?

1064
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:03,433
(laughing)

1065
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,310
You haven't said
you're sorry yet.

1066
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:07,813
Right.
Of course.

1067
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,902
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1068
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:15,863
For what, Jim?

1069
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,739
For underestimating you.

1070
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:18,782
-Mm.

1071
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,409
And any other
woman like you.

1072
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:24,746
Though I don't imagine
there's many.

1073
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:28,959
That's good practice,
right there.

1074
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:31,753
(radio beeping)

1075
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,255
MAN (over radio):
We interrupt this musical

1076
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,424
programming with breaking news.

1077
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,968
The Soviet news agency
has announced

1078
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,095
that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,

1079
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,472
has become
the first man in space.

1080
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,391
Gagarin completed
one full orbit

1081
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,894
around the planet
in 108 minutes.

1082
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,937
Stay tuned to this station
for more details

1083
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:50,522
as they become available.

1084
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:54,151
Well, guess that puts us
behind the curve.

1085
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:55,986
ANNOUNCER:
The Vostok-1 rocket delivered

1086
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,488
Russian cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin's 3KA capsule

1087
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,658
into orbit at 6:07 UTC,

1088
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,537
reentering Russian airspace
at 7:55 UTC,

1089
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,788
proving conclusively

1090
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,208
that man could survive
orbital space flight.

1091
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,501
Gagarin was awarded

1092
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,044
the Order of Lenin
and the Gold Star--

1093
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:15,464
Well, they beat
the pants off us. Let's go.

1094
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:17,591
Let's learn
how to fly to space.

1095
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:20,052
ANNOUNCER:
"First Soviet Astronaut,"

1096
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:23,013
and has been proclaimed
a national hero.

1097
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:26,099
This is a day
of unprecedented triumph

1098
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,060
for the Russian space program

1099
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:32,105
and a crushing blow for America
in the race for space.

1100
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:35,484
I want to thank everyone
for staying.

1101
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,819
I know it's late,
and after what I just saw,

1102
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,447
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

1103
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:44,785
Before we do,
I just have to ask a question...

1104
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:47,871
the same one I've
been asking myself

1105
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:49,373
all the way over here,
which is...

1106
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,961
How in the hell did we find
ourself in second place

1107
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:55,838
in a two-man race?

1108
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,840
Anybody?

1109
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,007
Paul?

1110
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,010
And I think
Glenn said it pretty well.

1111
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:03,512
They're just outworking us.

1112
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:06,723
The reason I have to think that
is because I refuse to believe

1113
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:08,433
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1114
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,060
or that they have
more technology

1115
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,603
or that they care more.

1116
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:16,316
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1117
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,027
Is it possible that it actually
means more to them?

1118
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,407
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

1119
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:26,535
We're not on
some epic joyride.

1120
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:28,328
I just saw seven faces

1121
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,414
who aren't sure
that we can get there.

1122
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,712
This is our problem.

1123
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:39,298
And so as of right now...

1124
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:43,093
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

1125
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:44,678
One is staying here,
working late,

1126
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,139
that's gonna be
a fact of life.

1127
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,682
And two, don't expect
your paychecks

1128
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,225
to reflect the extra time
it's gonna take

1129
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,227
to catch up
and pass those bastards.

1130
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:55,731
For those of you
who can't work that way,

1131
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:58,108
I understand and thank you
for what you've done.

1132
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:01,695
For everyone else...

1133
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,906
I suggest you call your wives

1134
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:05,574
and tell them
how it's gonna be.

1135
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:07,534
I'll start with mine.

1136
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,705
(murmuring)

1137
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,517
(murmuring continuing)

1138
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,285
(up-tempo jazz music playing)

1139
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,219
Sam, turn it up.
Turn it up.

1140
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,262
Yes, sir.

1141
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,099
-John.
-Morning, sir.

1142
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,726
(whirring)

1143
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:20,065
(speaking indistinctly)

1144
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:28,740
End of the day.

1145
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:35,914
Okay, we're looking good.

1146
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:42,504
Okay.

1147
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,755
Okay.

1148
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,804
(sighs)

1149
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,057
Sir, it might be
the selector latch.

1150
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,642
I'm taking a walk.

1151
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,436
We're honored to serve
our country.

1152
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,813
So we don't think
about danger.

1153
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,982
We don't have time
to be scared.

1154
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:03,817
We got a job to do.

1155
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,116
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1156
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:14,494
WOMAN:
Mrs. Jackson.

1157
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,705
Colored seats are
at the back of the courtroom.

1158
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,290
Thank you, ma'am.

1159
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:39,269
So, which one of you
wants to go first?

1160
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,856
(laughing)

1161
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,149
(applauding)

1162
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:07,381
The IBM 7090
Data Processing System.

1163
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,716
It has the capability
of solving

1164
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:15,138
over 24,000 multiplications...
per second.

1165
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,182
Holy Moses,
that's lightning fast.

1166
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,600
They'll never get that to work.

1167
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,644
(chuckles)
Oh, it'll run eventually.

1168
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:23,021
And when it does, we have to
know how to program it.

1169
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:24,439
Unless you'd rather
be out of a job.

1170
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,108
ALL:
No, ma'am.

1171
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,282
Mr. Z!

1172
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,784
I got a court date.

1173
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,248
"The computer uses it

1174
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,958
"as its high-speed
storage unit,

1175
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,127
an information-holding device."

1176
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,920
Hmm.

1177
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,297
So you have a brain.

1178
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,382
That I can work with.

1179
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:55,554
Well, that's in the wrong spot.

1180
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,186
Attagirl.

1181
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,148
-HARRISON: Ruth.
-Yes, sir.

1182
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,191
Get me the Cape on the line.

1183
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:09,067
Shepard's trajectories
need to be updated.

1184
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:12,988
Wow.

1185
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:15,949

Everywhere I look, you're

It's not my imagination.

1204
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:21,974
Now where the hell
do you go every day?

1205
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,520
To the bathroom, sir.

1206
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,355
To the bathroom?

1207

There's no bathroom
for me here.

What do you mean there's
no bathroom for you here?

1213
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:50,002
There is no bathroom.

1214
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,838
There are no colored bathrooms
in this building

1215
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,923
or any building outside
the West Campus,

1216
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,425
which is half a mile away.

1217
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:57,759
Did you know that?

1218
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,764
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself.

1219
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,017
And I can't use
one of the handy bikes.

1220
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:06,977
Picture that, Mr. Harrison.

1221
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:08,937
My uniform--

1222
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,732
skirt below my knees, my heels,

1223
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:13,275
and a simple string of pearls.

1224
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,110
Well, I don't own pearls.

1225
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:19,448
Lord knows you don't pay
coloreds enough to afford pearls!

1226
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:23,702
And I work like a dog,
day and night,

1227
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:27,831
living off of coffee from a pot
none of you wanna touch!

1228
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:29,917
(Katherine's breath trembling)

1229
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:40,135
(inhales deeply)

1230
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:42,846
(softly) So, excuse me

1231
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:46,350
if I have to go to the restroom
a few times a day.

1232
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:31,103
(metal clanging)

1233
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:42,155
(grunts)

1234
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:51,081
(grunts)

1235
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,381
There we have it.

1236
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:04,928
No more colored restrooms.

1237
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:08,348
No more white restrooms.

1238
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,226
-Just plain old toilets.
-(crowbar clangs)

1239
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,228
Go wherever
you damn well please.

1240
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,980
Preferably closer to your desk.

1241
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:26,033
Here at NASA,
we all pee the same color.

1242
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,639
(knocking on door)

1243
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,182
(coughing)

1244
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:54,353
Heard you was fighting
the flu.

1245
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,230
Figured you could use
some soup.

1246
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,731
Hot meal for the girls.

1247
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,526
Come on in. (chuckles)

1248
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,615
(clears throat)

1249
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,075
Excuse me.

1250
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:10,577
Okay, ladies.
Let's say grace.

1251
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,121
Bow your heads.

1252
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,670
Dear Lord,
thank you for this meal.

1253
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,755
We ask that you bless this food

1254
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:23,966
so that it may bless our bodies.

1255
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,009
In Jesus's name we pray.

1256
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,555
-Amen.
-Amen.

1257
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,853
REPORTER: It's a historic day,
here at Cape Canaveral,

1258
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,396
and here's
what we can expect.

1259
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:40,440
Alan Shepard and Freedom 7
will be launched into space

1260
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:43,360
at an altitude
of about 116 miles an hour.

1261
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:45,487
Dorothy, come on,
you gonna miss it!

1262
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:46,530
DOROTHY:
I'm coming.

1263
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:49,658
...will land about 35 miles
off the coast of Florida

1264
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,826
where he'll be picked up

1265
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:53,537
by the men of
the USS Lake Champlain

1266
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,790
who set out
for this historic purpose.

1267
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,917
MAN (over radio): Freedom 7,
we're gonna have to bleed off

1268
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,295
some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank.

1269
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:04,464
That should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule. Over.

1270
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,216
Any day now, CAPCOM.

1271
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,719
SHEPARD (over radio): Fix your little
problem and light this candle.

1272
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,305
Roger that, Freedom 7.
Stand by.

1273
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,015
Temperature is returning
to normal.

1274
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,892
Running one more
launch status check.

1275
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,143
All systems now go.

1276
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:17,811
Move to final
countdown sequence.

1277
01:06:17,853 --> 01:06:19,521
Moving to final
countdown sequence.

1278
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,231
SHEPARD (over radio):
Roger that.

1279
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:23,317
We're at T-minus 10,

1280
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:24,568
nine,

1281
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,861
eight,

1282
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,321
seven,

1283
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,697
six,

1284
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:30,073
five,

1285
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:31,533
four,

1286
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:32,618
three,

1287
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,994
two,

1288
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,454
one,

1289
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:36,705
zero.

1290
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:38,957
(roaring)

1291
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:40,876
We have ignition.

1292
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,128
And we have liftoff.

1293
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,505
Get up there.

1294
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:46,882
SHEPARD: Liftoff,
and the clock is started.

1295
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:49,134
(rattling)

1296
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:53,639
(over radio): Fuel is go.
Two-point-five g.

1297
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,890
Get on up there.

1298
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:58,018
Liftoff at 34 minutes
after the hour.

1299
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,021
(roaring)

1300
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,315
(rattling)

1301
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,874
Pitch 88. Trajectory is good.

1302
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:25,420
Yaw is okay.

1303
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,339
Switching manual roll.

1304
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,508
-Yes!
-(cheering)

1305
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:33,637
JOHN F. KENNEDY:
For the eyes of the world

1306
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,931
now look into space,

1307
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:38,475
to the Moon and
to the planets beyond.

1308
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,687
-Yes!
-And we have vowed

1309
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,189
that we shall not see it
governed

1310
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:47,109
by a hostile flag of conquest

1311
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:50,571
but by a banner of freedom
and peace.

1312
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:53,866
We set sail on this new sea

1313
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:57,327
because there is
new knowledge to be gained

1314
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:59,371
and new rights to be won.

1315
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,457
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

1316
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,209
and do the other things,

1317
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:08,130
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

1318
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,591
Suppose we should all thank
President Kennedy

1319
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:12,634
for the continued job security.

1320
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,428
(snapping)

1321
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:18,432
Uh, Gus Grissom's up next.

1322
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,518
Another suborbital flight
with a Redstone.

1323
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,229
It's our last shot before
we strap Glenn to the Atlas

1324
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,857
and pray we can bring
him back down.

1325
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:28,442
Yes, and I imagine
he'd like us

1326
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:30,234
to have the math worked out
beforehand.

1327
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,029
(laughter)

1328
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:33,947
Good work, gentlemen.

1329
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:37,910
Go have dinner with your kids
and let's get back to work.

1330
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:52,549
♪ Look what
you've done to me ♪

1331
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,926
♪ Look what you've
done to me ♪

1332
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:58,471
♪ You make me behave
like I wouldn't ever ♪

1333
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,265
♪ I know you're
the one for me ♪

1334
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,100
♪ You're the one for me ♪

1335
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:06,979
♪ Your essence is the ink
in the word "forever" ♪

1336
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,944
I think it's high time
I kissed you, Katherine.

1337
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,323
Oh. And why is that?

1338
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,495
Figured you attracted to me,
same as I to you.

1339
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:25,457
-Is that right?
-Mmm-hmm.

1340
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:28,085
Or you would have told me
to get going a long time ago.

1341
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,212
(laughing)

1342
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:45,018
Haven't kissed a man
in a long time.

1343
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,145
Almost forgot how to.

1344
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,494
REPORTER (over TV):
The FBI has arrested

1345
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:03,495
four white men

1346
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:06,540
accused of throwing a firebomb
into a Freedom Rider bus

1347
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,792
outside of Anniston, Alabama.

1348
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,128
-Hi, baby.
-Hi, Mama.

1349
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,005
MAN (on TV):
We all hit the floor.

1350
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,382
All of us realized
that the bus was on fire

1351
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:17,426
and had to go out
into the mob.

1352
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:18,552
The kids don't need

1353
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:20,387
-to be watching this.
-They need to see this.

1354
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,097
Well, when we got off
the bus in Birmingham...

1355
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:23,640
LEVI:
Everybody needs to see this.

1356
01:10:23,682 --> 01:10:25,559
...took me and forced me
out of the door...

1357
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,102
and threw me into the crowd.

1358
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:29,646
And then I was beaten
by one big guy and several others.

1359
01:10:29,688 --> 01:10:32,983
We think we're rendering
a great service to our nation.

1360
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:35,861
For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

1361
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:38,864
It is a struggle to save
the soul of America.

1362
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,574
WOMAN:
Mary Jackson.

1363
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:43,702
Petition to attend courses
at Hampton High School

1364
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,624
Good morning, Your Honor.

1365
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:56,924
Hampton High School is
a white school, Mrs. Jackson.

1366
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,009
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

1367
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,178
Virginia,
still a segregated state.

1368
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,263
Regardless of what
the federal government says,

1369
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:05,599
regardless of what
the Supreme Court says,

1370
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:08,185
our law is the law.

1371
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:10,562
Your Honor, if I may.

1372
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:13,482
I believe there are special
circumstances to be considered.

1373
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:15,442
What would warrant
a colored woman

1374
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,111
attending a white school?

1375
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:19,947
May I approach your bench, sir?

1376
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:36,296
Your Honor, you of all people
should understand

1377
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,549
the importance of being first.

1378
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,968
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

1379
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,136
Well, you were the first
in your family

1380
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:45,180
to serve in the armed forces.

1381
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,515
US Navy.

1382
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:49,017
The first to attend university.

1383
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,686
George Mason.

1384
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,063
And the first state judge
to be recommissioned

1385
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:55,566
by three
consecutive governors.

1386
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:57,693
You've done some research.

1387
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,152
Yes, sir.

1388
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:00,904
What's the point?

1389
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,406
The point is, Your Honor,

1390
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,783
no Negro woman
in the state of Virginia

1391
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,286
has ever attended
an all-white high school.

1392
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:08,453
It's unheard of.

1393
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,831
Yes. Unheard of.

1394
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,584
And before Alan Shepard sat
on top of a rocket,

1395
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,211
no other American
had ever touched space.

1396
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:18,297
And now, he will forever
be remembered

1397
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,883
as the US Navy man
from New Hampshire,

1398
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:23,010
the first to touch the stars.

1399
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,013
And I, sir,

1400
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:28,682
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

1401
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,767
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

1402
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:33,353
at that all-white high school.

1403
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:36,732
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

1404
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:41,153
So I have no choice
but to be the first.

1405
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:44,239
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

1406
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,951
Your Honor, out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today,

1407
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:51,330
which one is gonna matter
a hundred years from now?

1408
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,124
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

1409
01:12:57,127 --> 01:13:00,589
(chuckles, mutters)
I'll be darned.

1410
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:09,223
Only the night classes,
Mrs. Jackson.

1411
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:14,436
(yells)

1412
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,066
Yes, yes, yes!

1413
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:20,192
Yes!

1414
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:23,946
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

1415
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,513
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

1416
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,431
-KATHERINE: Excuse me.
-No more than five minutes, sir.

1417
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:53,100
Gus Grissom's
coordinates.

1418
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:56,061
I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1419
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:59,064
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

1420
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,107
An orbital launch

1421
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:02,484
with an Atlas rocket
is going to take time.

1422
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,278
Is there a problem?

1423
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:08,907
Mr. Harrison...
I was wondering.

1424
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:09,950
Uh-huh. Well,

1425
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,201
I've been wondering
my whole life,

1426
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:12,995
so you just spit it out.

1427
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,289
Well, sir...

1428
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,252
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1429
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:21,628
This isn't about
plugging in numbers.

1430
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,963
It's about
inventing the math.

1431
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,673
And I think you and I talked
about that, right?

1432
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:27,009
-It doesn't exist.
-I can do it, sir.

1433
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,218
PAUL:
Do you have any idea how

1434
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,262
exacting these calculations
have to be?

1435
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:31,263
It's like shooting

1436
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,015
a sawed-off shotgun
from a thousand feet

1437
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:34,349
and getting that one BB

1438
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,143
through a hole so tiny,
you can't even see it.

1439
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,437
-Okay, let me see what you've got.
-I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1440
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,898
How have the Grissom
numbers been?

1441
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,441
They've been spot-on.

1442
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,863
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1443
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:48,989
But you run it all through

1444
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:50,532
-Stafford, understood?
-Yes, sir.

1445
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:52,242
Thank you.

1446
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,207
Computers
don't author reports.

1447
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:07,549
GRISSOM: (over radio) CAPCOM,
this is Liberty Bell 7.

1448
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:09,092
CAPCOM:
Loud and clear.

1449
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:12,721
Okay, it's a nice ride
up to now.

1450
01:15:12,763 --> 01:15:13,722
CAPCOM:
Roger.

1451
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:16,642
Liberty Bell 7, this is
Hunt 1 approaching.

1452
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:17,851
Ready to hook on. Over.

1453
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:20,062
GRISSOM: I read you
loud and clear. Over.

1454
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,523
The hatch is blown, CAPCOM.

1455
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,358
TV REPORTER:
The Liberty Bell 7 capsule

1456
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:25,609
is taking on water.

1457
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,694
Gus Grissom is
out of the capsule.

1458
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,280
Rescuers are
now going to pull him

1459
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:31,615
from the ocean waves.

1460
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:34,743
Unfortunately,
the Liberty Bell 7 capsule...

1461
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:35,702
is lost.

1462
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:36,745
Mama.

1463
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:39,665
-I can't, I can't.
-Mary.

1464
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:48,715
MAN:
Mr. Harrison, taxpayer money

1465
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:50,759
sank in the ocean
along with your capsule.

1466
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:51,677
So what makes you think

1467
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,846
you can bring John Glenn
home safely?

1468
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:55,848
Let me say first,
discovery is never

1469
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:57,516
just for the sake
of discovery, gentlemen,

1470
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,643
but for the sake
of human survival,

1471
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:02,521
and it will always come
with a risk.

1472
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,316
Whoever gets there first
will make the rules,

1473
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,193
that's been true
of every civilization.

1474
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,319
And so...

1475
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,239
I think the bigger question
for this body to consider is

1476
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:16,577
who do you want calling
the shots in space?

1477
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:19,329
We have to know
what's out there, Senator.

1478
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:20,747
We have to touch the stars,

1479
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:23,292
if only to ensure our
own survival,

1480
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,002
and only a man can do that.

1481
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,924
We'll get John Glenn home
safely because we have to,

1482
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:33,427
because he has to tell us
what he saw.

1483
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:39,391
PAUL: The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1484
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,226
But the capsule didn't have
enough speed

1485
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:43,645
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1486
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:47,107
Essentially a triangle:
Earth, suborbit, Earth.

1487
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:48,901
That math was known.

1488
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,445
That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

1489
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,698
That cannot take Glenn.

1490
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,700
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1491
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:59,077
that can push us into orbit.

1492
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,081
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1493
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:04,958
Earth's gravity keeps
pulling at it,

1494
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,753
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1495
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,671
That's how it stays in orbit.

1496
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:12,424
Now, getting it back down...

1497
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,551
that's the math we don't know.

1498
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:17,721
Yes, Katherine.

1499
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,474
So the capsule will spin around
the Earth forever

1500
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:22,434
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1501
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,102
That's right.

1502
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:27,397
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1503
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,442
at precisely the right amount,
that's the task.

1504
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,613
Yes, Katherine.

1505
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:37,950
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1506
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:41,703
to a parabolic orbit.

1507
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,539
Yes.

1508
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,707
That's the go-no-go.

1509
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:48,335
Now at this point,
it's a pinhead.

1510
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:51,755
-We bring him in too soon...
-He burns up on reentry.

1511
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,173
That's right.

1512
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:54,633
We bring him in too late,

1513
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,426
he's pushed out
of Earth's gravity.

1514
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:59,930
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time,

1515
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:04,184
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind

1516
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:06,395
would alter the go-no-go,

1517
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:09,398
and we start
our calculations over.

1518
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,525
Yes.

1519
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:16,446
So we need to be able
to choose this reentry point.

1520
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:19,616
Now this go-no-go,
this has to be exact.

1521
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,285
Sam.

1522
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:23,579
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1523
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,955
in current capsule data.

1524
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:27,749
-Obviously, we know the launch spot.
-Thanks.

1525
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,501
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1526
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:31,420
where the Navy needs
the recovery zone,

1527
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:34,006
then we work backwards
from there.

1528
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:37,718
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1529
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:40,637
-Uh... Mr. Stafford.
-What, Katherine?

1530
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,097
If I could attend
the briefings,

1531
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:44,391
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1532
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:46,393
Pentagon briefings are
closed-door.

1533
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,313
Yes, but if we don't have
the information

1534
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:51,982
of the changes,
we can't keep up.

1535
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:53,317
I need those changes
as they occur.

1536
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:54,610
As you said,
it's a pinhead.

1537
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:56,528
Katherine,
that's the job.

1538
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,155
You asked
for this assignment,

1539
01:18:58,197 --> 01:19:00,407
so just calculate
with what you have.

1540
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,409
Or we'll find
someone who can.

1541
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:05,954
(sighs)

1542
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,167
Okay.

1543
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,349
Attagirl. (chuckles)

1544
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,601
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1545
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:28,810
Who are you?

1546
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:30,771
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

1547
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,357
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1548
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:35,234
Well, this is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1549
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:37,027
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1550
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:39,655
-Uh-huh.
-Bill, we've got numbers.

1551
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,408
What kind of numbers?

1552
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:48,872
Well, I'll be.

1553
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:51,917
What's your name again?

1554
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:54,211
Dorothy Vaughan.

1555
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:55,796
Dorothy Vaughan.

1556
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,014
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1557
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:07,516
Oh, this is all moot.

1558
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,560
We're altering the window
on the capsule.

1559
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:11,186
-When did this happen?
-Six minutes ago.

1560
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:12,771
The math is changing.
Start over.

1561
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:16,066
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current--

1562
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:17,442
Katherine,
we have been through this.

1563
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:18,610
It is not possible.

1564
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:20,612
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1565
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:23,156
There's no protocol for a man circling
the Earth either, sir.

1566
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,826
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1567
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:36,503
-(voices murmuring)
-(phone ringing)

1568
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:01,653
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1569
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:03,280
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1570
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:04,615
I have told you this.

1571
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:06,200
Computers don't author
reports. Fix it.

1572
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,493
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1573
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,579
That is not the way
this works.

1574
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,081
Paul. What's
happening here?

1575
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:15,459
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1576
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:16,418
And why is that?

1577
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,505
Well, sir, the data changes
so fast, the capsule changes.

1578
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:22,633
The weight and the landing zones
are all changing, every day.

1579
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:25,093
I do my work,
you attend these briefings,

1580
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:26,553
I have to start over.

1581
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:29,056
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1582
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:31,433
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1583
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:32,684
Why is it she can't attend?

1584
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,436
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1585
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:37,397
I cannot do my work effectively
if I do not have all of the data

1586
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,650
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1587
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,485
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1588
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:43,195
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1589
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:44,571
It requires
the highest clearance.

1590
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,698
I feel like I'm the best person
to present my calculations--

1591
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,700
-You're not gonna let this go, are you?
-No, I am not.

1592
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:49,785
And she is a woman.

1593
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:51,912
There is no protocol for a woman
attending these meetings.

1594
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:53,997
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1595
01:21:56,333 --> 01:22:00,087
But within these walls,
who, uh, who makes the rules?

1596
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,089
You, sir.
You are the boss.

1597
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,758
You just have to act
like one. Sir.

1598
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:16,144
You keep quiet.

1599
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:17,396
Thank you.

1600
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:19,273
Good morning.

1601
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:21,483
Gentlemen.

1602
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:23,235
(chattering)

1603
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,738
(chattering stops)

1604
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,702
This is Katherine Goble

1605
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:34,788
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window Division.

1606
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,249
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

1607
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:40,627
Come on.

1608
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:43,255
Want to get her a chair?

1609
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:44,798
We have a confirmed
launch window--

1610
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,258
-Get her a chair, please.
-Yes, sir.

1611
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,594
We have a confirmed launch
window for Friendship 7.

1612
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:50,304
Let's discuss a landing zone.

1613
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,806
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1614
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:55,267
Twenty miles square is
what we can service for retrieval.

1615
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:58,187
Outside of that, we risk
the capsule's recovery.

1616
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:00,772
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1617
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:02,816
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1618
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:03,901
With all due respect,

1619
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,695
our capsule's being altered daily.

1620
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:08,989
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

1621
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:10,991
Uh...

1622
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,915
17,544 miles per hour,

1623
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:19,833
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

1624
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:21,168
into low space orbit.

1625
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,423
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

1626
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,884
(laughter)

1627
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:31,345
Okay. So we have
the vehicle's speed,

1628
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:32,304
the launch window,

1629
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:33,639
and for argument's sake,

1630
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,849
the landing zone
is the Bahamas.

1631
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:37,643
Should be enough
to figure the go-no-go?

1632
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:39,353
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1633
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,146
We need to be past theory
at this point.

1634
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:44,191
We'll be able to calculate
a go-no-go with that information.

1635
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,568
When exactly is
that gonna happen?

1636
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,946
(chuckles)

1637
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,163
Katherine.

1638
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,543
Have a go at it.

1639
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:12,135
(clears throat)

1640
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:23,397
(inhales deeply)

1641
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:25,065
(exhales)

1642
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:32,948
The go point for
reentry is 2,990 miles...

1643
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:36,827
from where we want
Colonel Glenn to land.

1644
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:39,955
If we assume
that's the Bahamas,

1645
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:45,210
at 17,544 miles per hour,

1646
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,212
upon reentry,

1647
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:51,466
370 feet,
at a descent angle

1648
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:55,429
of 46.56 degrees.

1649
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,097
Distance is

1650
01:24:57,139 --> 01:25:00,767
velocity squared, sine,

1651
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,061
gravity squared.

1652
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,608
Sine, 32 feet.

1653
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:11,403
And the distance would be

1654
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:17,534
20,530,372 feet...

1655
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:23,916
or 2,990 miles...

1656
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:28,921
or 46.33 degrees.

1657
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:33,675
Okay, so that puts
your landing zone

1658
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:37,471
at 5.0667 degrees north,

1659
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:40,516
77.3333 degrees west.

1660
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,519
Which is here.

1661
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,190
Right here.

1662
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,400
Give or take 20 square miles.

1663
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:57,950
-I like her numbers.
-(chuckling)

1664
01:25:57,991 --> 01:26:00,202
Thank you.

1665
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:02,704
That, of course,
is assuming the capsule hits

1666
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:04,540
the reentry point exactly.

1667
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:07,209
How do we ensure that?

1668
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:09,962
Well, that's the math
we don't have yet, gentlemen.

1669
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,839
We're working on it.

1670
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:15,259
Katherine.

1671
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:21,515
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1672
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:23,851
Well, we're just getting up
to speed here, Mr. Harrison.

1673
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:25,060
I need more manpower.

1674
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:27,020
I need programmers,
folks to feed the cards.

1675
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,564
Get them, for crying out loud.

1676
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:29,731
-Okay.
-All right?

1677
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:31,859
-You're the IBM man, right?
-Yes, sir.

1678
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,861
Go pull them out of the sky
if you have to.

1679
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:35,946
Let's get ahead of this
thing or I'm not paying you.

1680
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:36,864
Understood.

1681
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:42,202
I got that one.
I got that one.

1682
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:45,372
I'm not paying any of you!

1683
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:57,885
-Me?
-Temporarily, yes.

1684
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,179
We need the IBM
for Glenn's launch.

1685
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,181
The lead engineer says
you're good with the cards,

1686
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:04,057
programming and such.

1687
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:05,392
What about the girls here?

1688
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:08,353
Well, human computers can't
calculate an orbital flight

1689
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:09,688
in the time we have.

1690
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,481
They'll stay put for now.

1691
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,026
What about after now?

1692
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,612
(stammering)
After Glenn's launch,

1693
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:18,947
NASA's dissolving
the computing groups.

1694
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:23,327
I'm not accepting
reassignment

1695
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:26,079
unless I bring
my ladies with me.

1696
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:27,581
Excuse me?

1697
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:30,042
We're gonna need a lot of manpower
to program that beast.

1698
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:31,460
I can't do it alone.

1699
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:34,630
My gals are ready.
They can do the work.

1700
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:39,343
DOROTHY:
Ladies.

1701
01:27:41,762 --> 01:27:43,388
We've been reassigned.

1702
01:27:44,765 --> 01:27:45,974
Leave your calculators.

1703
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,518
You won't need them
where we're going.

1704
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:55,317
(up-tempo jazz music playing)

1705
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,753
(chattering)

1706
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:49,746
BILL:
Welcome, ladies.

1707
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:02,050
You know what
your job is, Paul?

1708
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:06,096
To find the genius
among those geniuses.

1709
01:29:06,138 --> 01:29:08,557
To pull us all up.

1710
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:12,394
We all get to the peak together
or we don't get there at all.

1711
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,442
PAUL:
Yes. Well, good night, sir.

1712
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:50,182
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1713
01:29:50,224 --> 01:29:51,892
Class ends at nine.

1714
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,522
You got
something to say?

1715
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:59,441
I thought you might need these.

1716
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:05,072
You can refill them with
any weight lead you want.

1717
01:30:06,532 --> 01:30:10,118
You see, you just
hit the top like this.

1718
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,871
All right?
The lead comes out.

1719
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:14,831
You put the new lead in...

1720
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:17,668
and new pencil.

1721
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:24,383
You're gonna make
a fine engineer.

1722
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:25,676
You think so?

1723
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:27,845
Yes.

1724
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,889
And nobody dare stand
in the way

1725
01:30:30,931 --> 01:30:33,433
-of Mary Jackson's dreams.
-(chuckles)

1726
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:34,935
Myself included.

1727
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:42,734
(whispers)
Don't make me mad again.

1728
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:43,986
Yes, ma'am.

1729
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:49,741
And don't make
me late, either.

1730
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:51,451
You gonna be late.
I'm gonna make you late.

1731
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:52,911
-(chuckles)
-You won't be late.

1732
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:01,795
All right, gentlemen.
Tonight, we discuss

1733
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:04,923
Planck-Einstein
wavelength relationships.

1734
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:10,179
Yes?

1735
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:14,266
I'm Mary Jackson.
I'm enrolled.

1736
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:20,564
Well, the curriculum is not
designed for teaching a woman.

1737
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:22,608
Well, I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

1738
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:26,445
I don't see
a colored section.

1739
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:28,947
Should I just take any seat?

1740
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:34,828
Thank you.

1741
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,877
Okay. Uh...

1742
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:45,130
(clears throat)
Planck-Einstein.

1743
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:46,673
KATHERINE:
The problem

1744
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:49,468
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

1745
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:51,803
to a parabolic orbit.

1746
01:31:51,845 --> 01:31:54,431
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

1747
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:57,017
Because we can calculate
launch and landing,

1748
01:31:57,059 --> 01:31:58,560
but without this conversion,

1749
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:00,979
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

1750
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:05,484
Maybe we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

1751
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:06,568
PAUL:
How's that?

1752
01:32:11,073 --> 01:32:12,741
Maybe it's not
new math at all.

1753
01:32:14,826 --> 01:32:17,496
It could be old math.

1754
01:32:17,538 --> 01:32:19,790
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

1755
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:21,500
and not theoretically.

1756
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:23,335
Math is always dependable.

1757
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:25,671
For you it is.

1758
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:33,470
Euler's method.

1759
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:35,597
-Euler's method.
-Yes.

1760
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:38,600
-That's ancient.
-But it works.

1761
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:40,352
It works numerically.

1762
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:03,083
(chalk squeaking)

1763
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:17,931
That's it.

1764
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:22,352
-Let's type it up.
-Okay.

1765
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:26,440
Huh.

1766
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:43,290
(door opens)

1767
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:48,837
Dorothy.

1768
01:33:49,713 --> 01:33:51,048
Mrs. Mitchell.

1769
01:33:57,346 --> 01:33:59,223
You're working late today.

1770
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:02,643
Seems to always
happen that way.

1771
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:04,686
Yes. Seems to.

1772
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,564
(clears throat)

1773
01:34:12,402 --> 01:34:13,570
Thank you.

1774
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:20,452
I hear the IBM's
up to full capacity.

1775
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:23,830
You certainly have
a knack for it.

1776
01:34:23,872 --> 01:34:27,584
My father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics.

1777
01:34:27,626 --> 01:34:29,878
You know, I have a few girls
in the East Group

1778
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,256
that have an interest
in learning more about it.

1779
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:33,674
It is the future.

1780
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:36,802
I may bring them by,
if it's all the same to you.

1781
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:39,096
That's not my decision,
ma'am.

1782
01:34:39,137 --> 01:34:40,806
That would be
the supervisor.

1783
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:43,433
Yes, that's true.

1784
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:47,312
Well, good night,
Mrs. Mitchell.

1785
01:34:49,231 --> 01:34:50,732
You know, Dorothy.

1786
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:54,361
Despite what you may think...

1787
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:57,823
I have nothing
against y'all.

1788
01:34:57,865 --> 01:34:59,157
I know.

1789
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:02,494
I know you
probably believe that.

1790
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:17,301
DOROTHY:
Good night, Katherine.

1791
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:19,011
Good night.

1792
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:22,556
-Mama!
-Hey, babies.

1793
01:35:22,598 --> 01:35:25,142
-Mama.
-Hi.

1794
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,727
Hey.

1795
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:29,605
Oh, please don't tell me
I missed someone's birthday.

1796
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:32,024
-No, you didn't.
-No, you didn't, Mama.

1797
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:33,775
Madame, your seat.

1798
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:35,569
Well, thank you. (chuckles)

1799
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:38,655
What? Wait.
Is it my birthday?

1800
01:35:38,697 --> 01:35:39,823
ALL:
No, Mama.

1801
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:43,577
KATHERINE:
You all look so pretty.

1802
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:45,662
(chuckles)

1803
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:47,873
Mama, what's going on?

1804
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,377
Good evening, Katherine.

1805
01:35:57,758 --> 01:35:59,551
So you're not gonna say
anything?

1806
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:01,261
It's not my place.

1807
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:04,264
You, either?

1808
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:09,102
Okay. Well, I'm not
gonna do this all night.

1809
01:36:09,978 --> 01:36:11,438
(Katherine gasps)

1810
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,482
(whispers)
Oh, mother of mercy.

1811
01:36:13,524 --> 01:36:15,192
That's for me.

1812
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:20,781
-Are you sad, Mama?
-No.

1813
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:23,200
-It's okay, Mama.
-He's a good man.

1814
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:24,910
I know. I know.

1815
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:26,578
(voice breaking) I just--
I just can't help it.

1816
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,288
He hasn't even
asked you yet.

1817
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:31,291
I know, but he is.

1818
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,836
-You are, right?
-If y'all will let me.

1819
01:36:33,877 --> 01:36:36,088
-Well, go on.
-She's already crying.

1820
01:36:36,129 --> 01:36:37,589
Oh, hush.

1821
01:36:37,631 --> 01:36:39,424
This was my mother's ring.

1822
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,635
(whispers)
It's beautiful.

1823
01:36:41,677 --> 01:36:43,554
She and my father
were married for...

1824
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:44,596
For 52 years.

1825
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:48,600
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

1826
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:52,604
The day I met you,
I called my mother

1827
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:55,899
and I said, "Mom, I met
the woman I want to marry."

1828
01:36:55,941 --> 01:36:57,192
What'd she say?

1829
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:58,777
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy.

1830
01:36:58,819 --> 01:37:01,196
-Really something."
-Then what'd you say?

1831
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:03,657
I said, "No.

1832
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:05,701
"She's more than something.

1833
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:08,078
She's everything."

1834
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,872
Now...

1835
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:11,540
I planned on this being
more romantic.

1836
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:12,916
I'll make that up
to you real soon.

1837
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:15,210
-It's okay.
-But, uh...

1838
01:37:15,252 --> 01:37:17,671
But I know marrying you

1839
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:19,548
includes marrying
your girls as well.

1840
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:23,594
Amen to that.

1841
01:37:23,635 --> 01:37:24,595
I do.

1842
01:37:24,636 --> 01:37:26,930
(chuckles)
I didn't ask you yet.

1843
01:37:26,972 --> 01:37:29,099
Hurry up.

1844
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:30,684
(sobbing)

1845
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:32,394
Oh, my goodness.

1846
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:34,229
Oh!

1847
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:39,109
My babies. Look, girls,
isn't it beautiful?

1848
01:37:40,068 --> 01:37:42,905
-Look, Mama.
-I see.

1849
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:44,740
ANNOUNCER:
The Mercury-Atlas space vehicle

1850
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:46,158
which will put John Glenn,

1851
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,826
the first American,
into Earth's orbit,

1852
01:37:47,868 --> 01:37:51,163
has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests.

1853
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:52,164
NASA has confirmed

1854
01:37:52,206 --> 01:37:55,167
that the IBM 790
Data Processing System

1855
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:57,503
has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission's

1856
01:37:57,544 --> 01:37:59,880
launch and recovery
system calculations.

1857
01:37:59,922 --> 01:38:01,924
The modifications
and equipment installations

1858
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:04,176
-are progressing on schedule.
-Yes, sir.

1859
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:05,344
Right in here.

1860
01:38:06,637 --> 01:38:07,763
You wanted
to see me, sir?

1861
01:38:07,804 --> 01:38:09,890
Have a seat.

1862
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:11,725
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Harrison?

1863
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:13,352
No, there's nothing wrong.

1864
01:38:15,103 --> 01:38:16,980
In fact, our IBM is
churning out numbers

1865
01:38:17,022 --> 01:38:19,233
in fractions of the time
any human can.

1866
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:21,610
Present company included.

1867
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:23,111
That's good then.

1868
01:38:26,031 --> 01:38:28,116
Yeah, maybe.

1869
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:29,743
The thing is,
the Cape's now insisting

1870
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:32,079
on doing all the backups
down there, on site.

1871
01:38:33,288 --> 01:38:34,331
I see.

1872
01:38:34,373 --> 01:38:36,375
So we won't be running
backups here.

1873
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,710
And truth be told,

1874
01:38:38,752 --> 01:38:40,420
we can't keep up
with that IBM anyhow.

1875
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:44,591
Long story short,

1876
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:47,219
we no longer need
a computer in this department.

1877
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,472
Progress is
a double-edged sword.

1878
01:38:50,514 --> 01:38:51,390
(sighs)

1879
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:58,438
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1880
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,941
We'll see if we can find
another assignment.

1881
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:02,317
Thank you, sir.

1882
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:07,197
Katherine, I'm...

1883
01:39:09,366 --> 01:39:12,035
I'm sorry about this.

1884
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:14,246
It's out of my hands,
if you can believe that.

1885
01:39:15,581 --> 01:39:16,790
I understand.

1886
01:39:19,668 --> 01:39:21,128
(sighs)

1887
01:39:40,105 --> 01:39:41,023
Katherine.

1888
01:39:43,192 --> 01:39:45,068
We heard you got engaged.

1889
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,778
Yes.

1890
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,947
That's thoughtful of you.

1891
01:39:53,535 --> 01:39:54,536
(gasps)

1892
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,955
They're lovely.

1893
01:39:56,997 --> 01:39:59,374
Mr. Harrison's idea,
really.

1894
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:02,503
Although I suspect his wife
did the picking out.

1895
01:40:02,544 --> 01:40:05,339
Can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers.

1896
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:08,217
Now you have
a great wedding.

1897
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:12,471
You did good work
around here, Katherine.

1898
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,021
(inaudible)

1899
01:40:41,291 --> 01:40:43,085
-(church bell ringing)
-Hello there. Good to see you.

1900
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:44,545
-Hi, Reverend. How you doing?
-How are you?

1901
01:40:45,879 --> 01:40:47,506
KATHERINE:
I don't think I felt a thing

1902
01:40:47,548 --> 01:40:49,216
the first time I did this.

1903
01:40:49,258 --> 01:40:51,051
I was so nervous.

1904
01:40:51,093 --> 01:40:52,845
Mm.

1905
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:55,305
You're just as beautiful
as you were back then.

1906
01:40:55,347 --> 01:40:57,516
-You think so?
-Mmm.

1907
01:40:57,558 --> 01:40:59,393
-Just a little older.
-(gasps)

1908
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:01,562
-And a little fuller.
-(Dorothy laughs)

1909
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:03,313
But you look good.

1910
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,356
(sighs)

1911
01:41:05,899 --> 01:41:08,318
Well, here we go.

1912
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,945
-Again.
-(laughter)

1913
01:41:09,987 --> 01:41:11,405
Project Mercury,
named after

1914
01:41:11,446 --> 01:41:14,032
the winged messenger of the gods
in Roman mythology.

1915
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:17,828
Today, three years, two months,
and three days afterwards,

1916
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,413
we're ready,
after 10 scheduled attempts...

1917
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:20,497
Attagirl.

1918
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:23,083
...to try again to put
our first man into orbit,

1919
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:24,835
to put Colonel John Glenn
into orbit.

1920
01:41:24,877 --> 01:41:26,503
Colonel John Glenn will be
the first American

1921
01:41:26,545 --> 01:41:27,963
to orbit the Earth.

1922
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:30,507
As you can see, there are
thousands of people here today

1923
01:41:30,549 --> 01:41:32,301
to witness this historic event.

1924
01:41:33,302 --> 01:41:34,928
Paul, something's off here.

1925
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,181
These landing coordinates
don't match yesterday's.

1926
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:41,727
The IBM just ran them.

1927
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:45,063
So, then the IBM was
wrong yesterday. Right?

1928
01:41:46,315 --> 01:41:48,358
Or the damn thing's
wrong today.

1929
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:53,822
Paul, am I right?

1930
01:41:54,615 --> 01:41:56,241
It appears so.

1931
01:41:58,368 --> 01:41:59,912
HARRISON (over phone):
The IBM's been spot-on

1932
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:01,038
up to this point, John.

1933
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:03,332
But we'll run it again,
see what it comes up with.

1934
01:42:03,373 --> 01:42:05,209
Look, I'm gonna be honest
with you, Al.

1935
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,336
When I fly, I fly the machine.

1936
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:09,838
And right now it seems like
this machine is flying me.

1937
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,466
We're on the same page, John.
Our guys are on it.

1938
01:42:12,508 --> 01:42:14,301
Let's get the girl
to check the numbers.

1939
01:42:14,343 --> 01:42:16,803
-The girl?
-Yes, sir.

1940
01:42:18,764 --> 01:42:19,932
You mean Katherine?

1941
01:42:19,973 --> 01:42:22,100
Yes, sir. The smart one.

1942
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:24,603
I mean, she says they're
good, I'm ready to go.

1943
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:26,980
All right.
We'll get into it.

1944
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:28,273
GLENN:
Roger.

1945
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:31,318
Sam.

1946
01:42:32,236 --> 01:42:33,820
Go find Katherine Goble.

1947
01:42:33,862 --> 01:42:36,198
She needs to verify
Glenn's go-no-go

1948
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,491
or we're staying
on the ground.

1949
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:38,700
Yes, sir.

1950
01:42:40,452 --> 01:42:42,120

1955
01:43:02,516 --> 01:43:04,268
I'm looking
for Katherine Goble.

1956
01:43:04,309 --> 01:43:05,602
It's Katherine Johnson now.

1957
01:43:05,644 --> 01:43:07,187
They need you to verify
these coordinates.

1958
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:08,814
REPORTER (on TV):
...and tourists have poured

1959
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:11,024
into Cocoa Beach for weeks.

1960
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:12,025
Took this whole area

1961
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:14,862
surrounding Cape Canaveral
and Florida, really.

1962
01:43:14,903 --> 01:43:17,281
And all around the country,
it's as if time...

1963
01:43:17,322 --> 01:43:19,491
All right, give her
some space. Let her work.

1964
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:22,744
REPORTER: ...as we await
Colonel John Glenn's launch.

1965
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,455
A truly historic day
for America.

1966
01:43:25,497 --> 01:43:28,166
The country has waited
for several months,

1967
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:31,628
through many failed unmanned
Atlas rocket tests

1968
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:34,715
and 10 scheduled
manned attempts,

1969
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:36,884
which were canceled
for various mechanical

1970
01:43:36,925 --> 01:43:38,886
or system complications.

1971
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:42,681
REPORTER 2: All the final tests
and checks are being conducted.

1972
01:43:42,723 --> 01:43:45,767
John Glenn is ready to board
the Friendship 7.

1973
01:43:45,809 --> 01:43:48,103
REPORTER 1: But today
we remain truly optimistic,

1974
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:50,647
and it's a go day
in all regards.

1975
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:52,357
The capsule is ready.

1976
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:54,234
The rocket itself is A-Okay,

1977
01:43:54,276 --> 01:43:56,195
and the weather here
at Cape Canaveral...

1978
01:43:56,236 --> 01:43:58,572
-Anything from Langley?
-Not yet.

1979
01:43:58,614 --> 01:44:01,617
REPORTER 1: We are being told
that Mission Control at NASA

1980
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:03,327
is conducting a final check

1981
01:44:03,368 --> 01:44:05,287
of the launch
and recovery coordinates,

1982
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:08,832
including the go-no-go
calculations so crucial

1983
01:44:08,874 --> 01:44:10,876
to a safe and successful
launch and recovery.

1984
01:44:10,918 --> 01:44:12,294
REPORTER 2:
After years of waiting,

1985
01:44:12,336 --> 01:44:13,670
and months of delay,

1986
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:16,381
Colonel Glenn is finally ready
for that space flight

1987
01:44:16,423 --> 01:44:19,092
that we've been waiting for
with so much anticipation.

1988
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:20,969
REPORTER 1: These last-minute
checks could indicate

1989
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:23,013
a hesitancy
on NASA's behalf.

1990
01:44:23,055 --> 01:44:25,224
But let us say,
without reservation,

1991
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:27,267
that the safety
of Colonel John Glenn

1992
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:30,646
is paramount to the mission
and to the nation itself.

1993
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:32,314
No, sir.
We're still a go.

1994
01:44:32,356 --> 01:44:33,565
Yes, sir.

1995
01:44:33,607 --> 01:44:35,651

1996
01:44:37,277 --> 01:44:38,320

(telephone ringing)

2035
01:46:10,495 --> 01:46:12,080
Pad 14.

2036
01:46:24,134 --> 01:46:25,010
Katherine.

2037
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,391
Come on.

2038
01:46:35,062 --> 01:46:37,231
Sir, we've got
Pad 14 on the box.

2039
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:38,774
HARRISON: All right.
Let me in there.

2040
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:43,153
HARRISON:
This is Langley,

2041
01:46:43,195 --> 01:46:44,780
we have
the coordinates confirmed.

2042
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:46,323
MAN (over speakers):
Stand by, Langley.

2043
01:46:48,742 --> 01:46:49,826
HARRISON:
We can confirm

2044
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:52,871
the go-no-go point
for reentry is

2045
01:46:52,913 --> 01:46:58,418
16.11984 degrees latitude,

2046
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:04,007
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

2047
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:07,094
The launch window is a go.

2048
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:09,263
The landing coordinates match.

2049
01:47:09,304 --> 01:47:11,682
That is very good news, Al.

2050
01:47:11,723 --> 01:47:12,808
It's a little hard to trust

2051
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:14,268
something
you can't look in the eyes.

2052
01:47:14,309 --> 01:47:15,978
That's right, Colonel.

2053
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:17,646
Katherine did manage
to calculate

2054
01:47:17,688 --> 01:47:20,607
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal.

2055
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:22,693
GLENN (over speakers):
I will take every digit you got.

2056
01:47:22,734 --> 01:47:23,819
Be sure to thank her for me.

2057
01:47:23,861 --> 01:47:26,321
Gentlemen,
let's launch this rocket.

2058
01:47:26,363 --> 01:47:27,823
Good luck, Friendship 7.

2059
01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:29,283
Godspeed, Langley.

2060
01:47:32,619 --> 01:47:34,037
REPORTER:
Here at Cape Canaveral

2061
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:35,873
the countdown has resumed

2062
01:47:35,914 --> 01:47:39,376
as Colonel John Glenn is
now aboard the Friendship 7

2063
01:47:39,418 --> 01:47:42,379
high above
the Atlas rocket on Pad 14,

2064
01:47:42,421 --> 01:47:44,548
a height of over 93 feet.

2065
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:46,175
So far, the countdown is...

2066
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:48,343
REPORTER 2: These are pictures
from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2067
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:50,596
The gantry is now moving back.

2068
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:52,514
And we are a go for launch.

2069
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:56,059
MAN (on TV): The Mercury
spacecraft umbilical is out.

2070
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:58,187
T-minus 10 seconds
and counting.

2071
01:47:58,228 --> 01:47:59,188
Water systems, go.

2072
01:47:59,229 --> 01:48:00,564
-Mercury capsule, go.
-...eight, seven,

2073
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:02,566
-six, five...
-Ready engine. Start.

2074
01:48:02,608 --> 01:48:03,775
...four...

2075
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:06,028
-three, two...
-Good Lord, ride all the way.

2076
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:08,280
(over radio)
...one, zero.

2077
01:48:08,322 --> 01:48:09,531
Ignition.

2078
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:11,783
Liftoff.

2079
01:48:15,954 --> 01:48:18,081
The M-A 6 vehicle
has lifted off.

2080
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:22,586
It's getting
a little bumpy along here.

2081
01:48:22,628 --> 01:48:24,880
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

2082
01:48:24,922 --> 01:48:26,548
GLENN:
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2083
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:28,550
CAPCOM:
All systems are reported go.

2084
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:30,219
20 seconds to SECO.

2085
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,304
The trajectory is still A-Okay.

2086
01:48:32,346 --> 01:48:34,348
Go for SECO.

2087
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:35,766
GLENN:
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2088
01:48:35,807 --> 01:48:37,100
Go for SECO.

2089
01:48:41,688 --> 01:48:44,525
Zero G and I feel fine.

2090
01:48:44,566 --> 01:48:46,652
REPORTER: John Glenn reports
everything looks good.

2091
01:48:47,945 --> 01:48:50,447
Oh, that view is tremendous!

2092
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:53,951
Roger that, Friendship 7.

2093
01:48:58,914 --> 01:49:00,832
You are go for orbit.

2094
01:49:00,874 --> 01:49:02,417
Thank you, CAPCOM.

2095
01:49:07,506 --> 01:49:09,800
All right.
Ten and a half hours to go.

2096
01:49:09,842 --> 01:49:11,385
If we make seven round-trips.

2097
01:49:12,761 --> 01:49:15,848
I could use a coffee.

2098
01:49:15,889 --> 01:49:17,391
TV REPORTER:
Well, as we approach

2099
01:49:17,432 --> 01:49:19,476
the end of the day here
on the Eastern Seaboard,

2100
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:22,646
Colonel Glenn is just
beginning his third orbit

2101
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:25,315
three-quarters of the way across
the African continent.

2102
01:49:25,357 --> 01:49:27,109
We see he's
currently over Zanzibar

2103
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:29,778
which is the next tracking
station coming up.

2104
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,905
-Thankfully, the Friendship 7 capsule...
-(turns off broadcast)

2105
01:49:40,163 --> 01:49:42,291
New assignment
came down the pike.

2106
01:49:45,836 --> 01:49:48,130
Always changing
around here.

2107
01:49:48,172 --> 01:49:50,048
It's hard to keep up.

2108
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:54,386
Seems like they're going
to need a permanent team

2109
01:49:54,428 --> 01:49:56,180
to feed that IBM.

2110
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:57,723
How big of a team?

2111
01:49:57,764 --> 01:49:59,725
Thirty, to start.

2112
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:05,189
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

2113
01:50:06,356 --> 01:50:09,276
You're quite welcome,
Mrs. Vaughan.

2114
01:50:23,624 --> 01:50:24,625
Hmm.

2115
01:50:54,279 --> 01:50:56,323
We have a warning light.

2116
01:50:56,365 --> 01:50:58,450
CAPCOM 7,
I have a warning light.

2117
01:50:58,492 --> 01:51:00,327
Stand by, Seven.

2118
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:02,246
Sir, we have a warning light.

2119
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:07,417
What are we looking at, Paul?

2120
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:08,544
The, uh...

2121
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:10,337
The heat shield
may have come loose.

2122
01:51:10,379 --> 01:51:11,797
Seven, will you confirm

2123
01:51:11,839 --> 01:51:14,383
the landing bag
is in the off position?

2124
01:51:14,424 --> 01:51:16,510
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

2125
01:51:16,552 --> 01:51:19,805
Al, we need to get him down now.
He could burn up on reentry.

2126
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:31,984
Come on, babies.
There is a man in space,

2127
01:51:32,025 --> 01:51:33,902
and we don't want to miss it,
so we gotta hurry.

2128
01:51:33,944 --> 01:51:35,362
MAN: Something's
wrong with Glenn!

2129
01:51:35,404 --> 01:51:36,822
-What's going on?
-Come on, let's go.

2130
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:39,032
-Come on. Hurry up, now.
-MARY: Y'all follow me.

2131
01:51:40,367 --> 01:51:42,786
We just learned
that the Friendship 7

2132
01:51:42,828 --> 01:51:45,873
is in danger of losing
its heat shield.

2133
01:51:45,914 --> 01:51:48,125
Have you heard
any banging noises

2134
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:49,877
or anything of this type
at higher rates?

2135
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:51,461
That is a negative, CAPCOM.

2136
01:51:51,503 --> 01:51:53,380
This poses a grave danger
to the mission.

2137
01:51:53,422 --> 01:51:55,257
Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

2138
01:51:55,299 --> 01:51:57,634
Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

2139
01:51:57,676 --> 01:51:58,844
MAN (on radio):
NASA is confirming

2140
01:51:58,886 --> 01:52:00,053
there is some sort
of malfunction

2141
01:52:00,095 --> 01:52:03,765
with the capsule's heat shield
and it may not stay in place.

2142
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:05,851
If the heat shield's loose,

2143
01:52:05,893 --> 01:52:09,354
the retro-package straps
might... might hold it in place.

2144
01:52:09,396 --> 01:52:12,399
-Will that work?
-It will work.

2145
01:52:12,441 --> 01:52:15,152
It will hold it until he reaches
the go-no-go point.

2146
01:52:15,194 --> 01:52:16,278
It will work.

2147
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,823
Al, he has
to override the .05G.

2148
01:52:19,865 --> 01:52:21,658
Do it.

2149
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,285
Friendship 7,

2150
01:52:23,327 --> 01:52:26,163
we're recommending
that the retro-package not--

2151
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:28,415
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2152
01:52:28,457 --> 01:52:32,419
(over radio): This means that
you will have to override the .05G switch.

2153
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:33,587
Roger.

2154
01:52:33,629 --> 01:52:36,089
Is there a reason
for this? Over.

2155
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:37,132
Stand by, Seven.

2156
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:43,722
Not at this time, Seven.

2157
01:52:45,057 --> 01:52:46,517
Roger that, Command.

2158
01:52:46,558 --> 01:52:49,269
I will make a manual
.05G entry

2159
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:51,688
and bring the scope in. Over.

2160
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:56,485
He knows.

2161
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,744
REPORTER (over radio):
Without a heat shield,

2162
01:53:05,786 --> 01:53:07,746
there is no way that
Colonel Glenn can get back

2163
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:08,997
through the Earth's
atmosphere.

2164
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:11,375
The heat is simply
too overpowering.

2165
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,710
A malfunction in
the automatic control system

2166
01:53:13,752 --> 01:53:17,047
is causing the spacecraft to yaw
in a skid-like fashion.

2167
01:53:17,089 --> 01:53:21,260
Thus putting the Friendship 7's
reentry point in jeopardy.

2168
01:53:21,301 --> 01:53:24,847
Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking
towards the United States,

2169
01:53:24,888 --> 01:53:29,393
and he must begin the retro-sequence
300 miles west of California

2170
01:53:29,434 --> 01:53:32,521
if he's to reenter the atmosphere
at the designated point

2171
01:53:32,563 --> 01:53:37,484
and land in the recovery area
700 miles south and east of Florida.

2172
01:53:37,526 --> 01:53:40,279
Stay tuned to this station
for further details.

2173
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:43,740
You're going to be using
fly-by-wire for reentry.

2174
01:53:43,782 --> 01:53:46,577
You'll need to maintain
a zero angle, over.

2175
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:48,871
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

2176
01:53:48,912 --> 01:53:51,039
Back it up with manual. Over.

2177
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:52,374
Keep talking to him.

2178
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:56,044
Roger. The weather,
the recovery area

2179
01:53:56,086 --> 01:53:58,422
three-foot waves,
10 miles visibility.

2180
01:53:58,463 --> 01:54:00,966
-(distorted speech over radio)
-CAPCOM, you're going out.

2181
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:02,926
He's crossing
the communication blackout zone.

2182
01:54:06,013 --> 01:54:07,472
There's a real fireball outside.

2183
01:54:07,514 --> 01:54:09,141
It's getting
a little hot in here.

2184
01:54:09,183 --> 01:54:10,851
(distorted speech over radio)

2185
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:18,150
(distorted speech continues)

2186
01:54:22,196 --> 01:54:23,530
CAPCOM, do you copy?

2187
01:54:30,871 --> 01:54:32,414
(static crackling)

2188
01:54:50,682 --> 01:54:52,601
(static crackling)

2189
01:54:52,643 --> 01:54:55,103
Friendship 7, do you copy? Over.

2190
01:54:59,274 --> 01:55:00,400
Again.

2191
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:02,444
Friendship 7, do you copy? Over.

2192
01:55:17,042 --> 01:55:19,253
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2193
01:55:32,474 --> 01:55:34,810
-Loud and clear, CAPCOM.
-(excited chattering)

2194
01:55:34,852 --> 01:55:37,187
Roger that.
How are you doing?

2195
01:55:38,689 --> 01:55:41,525
My condition is good.
That was a real fireball. Boy!

2196
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:42,901
Roger that.

2197
01:55:42,943 --> 01:55:44,403
Let's get you
all the way home.

2198
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:45,863
GLENN (over speakers):
Roger that.

2199
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,739
Here's hoping these landing
coordinates still hold.

2200
01:55:47,781 --> 01:55:53,287
-Approaching 16.11984.
-Roger.

2201
01:55:53,328 --> 01:55:57,499
Approaching minus 165.2356...

2202
01:55:57,541 --> 01:56:00,586
in three, two, one.

2203
01:56:00,627 --> 01:56:02,129
Engaging chutes.

2204
01:56:03,797 --> 01:56:05,174
Beautiful chute!

2205
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:07,384
How are we looking, CAPCOM?

2206
01:56:07,426 --> 01:56:09,469
CAPCOM:
Your go-no-go is good.

2207
01:56:09,511 --> 01:56:12,389
Landing coordinates
are spot-on, Seven.

2208
01:56:12,431 --> 01:56:15,225
GLENN:
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2209
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:18,020
I've always wanted to swim
in the Bahamas. Over.

2210
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:21,732
(cheering)

2211
01:56:21,773 --> 01:56:25,152
John Glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered.

2212
01:56:25,194 --> 01:56:28,030
-Thank you!
-(cheering)

2213
01:56:28,071 --> 01:56:30,782
John Glenn has
splashed down safely

2214
01:56:30,824 --> 01:56:33,285
and is being recovered
by the USS Noa.

2215
01:56:36,121 --> 01:56:38,415
-Good job.
-Great job, guys.

2216
01:56:38,457 --> 01:56:39,458
HARRISON:
Katherine.

2217
01:56:44,338 --> 01:56:45,214
Nice work.

2218
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:48,091
You too,
Mr. Harrison.

2219
01:56:49,426 --> 01:56:50,511
So, um...

2220
01:56:52,137 --> 01:56:53,805
you think
we can get to the Moon?

2221
01:56:55,933 --> 01:56:58,352
We're already there, sir.

2222
01:56:59,645 --> 01:57:00,646
(chuckles)

2223
01:57:01,897 --> 01:57:02,898
Yeah.

2224
01:57:11,615 --> 01:57:13,033
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

2225
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:29,675
(cheering)

2226
01:57:40,978 --> 01:57:43,981
Girls, this is Mrs. Vaughan,

2227
01:57:44,022 --> 01:57:45,482
your supervisor.

2228
01:57:45,524 --> 01:57:46,984
She'll show you
how things work.

2229
01:57:47,776 --> 01:57:48,861
Come on in.

2230
01:57:51,238 --> 01:57:55,242
The IBM 7090
